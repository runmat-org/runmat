feat: First-class symbolic mathematics engine

Symbolic expressions are now native Value types in RunMat, enabling seamless
mixing of symbolic and numeric computation.

Highlights:
- sym, syms: Create symbolic variables with optional assumptions
- diff: Symbolic differentiation (higher-order supported)
- int: Symbolic integration (polynomials, transcendentals)
- solve: Linear and quadratic equation solving
- factor, collect, expand, simplify: Polynomial manipulation
- subs: Symbolic substitution
- matlabFunction: Compile expressions to callable function handles

Extended type support:
- Value::Symbolic variant integrated across 100+ builtins
- Proper error handling for symbolic inputs to numeric-only operations
- class(x) returns "sym" for symbolic values
- whos displays symbolic variable info

REPL improvements:
- Fixed cross-crate builtin registration (inventory linkage)
- Added format command infrastructure for output styling
