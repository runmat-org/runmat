**RustMat is a modern, high-performance runtime for MATLAB¬Æ and GNU Octave code, built from the ground up in Rust.** It features a V8-inspired tiered execution engine with a baseline interpreter and an optimizing JIT compiler, a high-performance generational garbage collector, a world-class interactive plotting library, and seamless Jupyter kernel integration. RustMat is designed to be blazingly fast, memory-safe, and highly extensible.

Whether you're running complex numerical simulations, executing scripts in a high-performance environment, or looking for a modern interactive experience in a Jupyter notebook, RustMat provides the power and safety of Rust with the familiar syntax of MATLAB.

## Why RustMat?

RustMat isn't just another MATLAB clone; it's a complete rethinking of the runtime, designed for the modern era of computing.

-   üöÄ **Blazing Fast Performance**: At its core is a V8-inspired, multi-tier execution engine. Code starts in the `Ignition` interpreter for fast startup, and a `Turbine` profiler identifies "hot" functions to be compiled to highly-optimized native machine code with our Cranelift-based JIT compiler.
-   üé® **Modern, Interactive Plotting**: Our `rustmat-plot` library provides a GPU-accelerated plotting experience powered by `wgpu`. Create beautiful, interactive 2D and 3D plots that are more responsive and aesthetically pleasing than traditional backends.
-   ü™ê **Full Jupyter Kernel Integration**: RustMat works as a first-class Jupyter kernel, allowing you to run MATLAB/Octave code in JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebooks with full support for plotting and interactive widgets.
-   ‚ö° **Instant Startup with Snapshots**: We've eliminated slow startup times. The `rustmat-snapshot` system pre-compiles the entire standard library into a binary blob that can be memory-mapped at launch, providing a near-instantaneous REPL and kernel startup.
-   üõ°Ô∏è **Memory Safe & Concurrent**: Built in Rust, RustMat guarantees memory safety, eliminating entire classes of bugs. Its generational garbage collector is designed for the demands of numerical computing, efficiently managing memory for large matrices and temporary objects.
-   üìÑ **MATLAB/Octave Compatibility**: The parser and runtime are designed to be highly compatible with existing MATLAB and GNU Octave scripts, making it easy to migrate your existing codebase.
-   üîß **Extensible Standard Library**: Adding new high-performance functions is trivial. Simply write a standard Rust function and add a `#[runtime_builtin]` macro. The runtime handles the rest, making it easy to extend RustMat with your own custom, high-performance code.

## üèÅ Getting Started

Getting up and running with RustMat is simple.

### Prerequisites

You need the Rust toolchain (>= 1.70) installed. You can get it from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).

### 1. Installation

Install RustMat directly from Crates.io using Cargo:

```bash
cargo install rustmat --features gui
```

To build from source for development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rustmat/rustmat.git
cd rustmat
cargo build --release --features gui
```

### 2. Running the REPL

Start the interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL):

```bash
rustmat
```

You'll be greeted with the RustMat prompt:

```
RustMat Interactive Console v0.0.1
High-performance MATLAB/Octave runtime with JIT compilation
JIT compiler: enabled (Cranelift optimization level: Speed)
Garbage collector: default
Type 'help' for help, 'exit' to quit, '.info' for system information

rustmat>
```

### 3. Running a Script

Execute any `.m` file directly:

```bash
rustmat run your_script.m
```

### 4. Using the Jupyter Kernel

To use RustMat in JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook, you need to register its kernelspec.

1.  **Ensure Jupyter is installed**: `pip install jupyterlab`
2.  **Register the kernel**: _(Note: A dedicated installer is planned. For now, this is a manual process.)_

    Create a file `kernel.json` in a directory like `~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/rustmat/`:

    ```json
    {
     "argv": ["/path/to/your/rustmat/binary", "kernel-connection", "{connection_file}"],
     "display_name": "RustMat",
     "language": "matlab"
    }
    ```

    Replace `/path/to/your/rustmat/binary` with the path to the compiled `rustmat` executable. Now, when you launch JupyterLab, "RustMat" will appear as an available kernel.

## üìñ Usage Examples

### Basic Arithmetic & Matrices

```matlab
% Basic arithmetic and variables
x = 5;
y = 3.14;
result = x * y + 2;
```

### Loops & Control Flow

```matlab
% Control flow with arithmetic conditions
if result - 15
    status = 1;  % Greater than 15
else
    status = 0;  % Less than or equal to 15
end

% For loops with ranges
sum = 0;
for i = 1:5
    sum = sum + i;
end

% While loops
counter = 0;
while counter - 3  % While counter != 3
    counter = counter + 1;
end

% Nested control structures
factorial = 1;
for n = 1:5
    factorial = factorial * n;
    if factorial - 100  % If factorial > 100
        break;
    end
end 
```

### Interactive Plotting

Create a beautiful, multi-plot figure with just a few lines of code.

```matlab
% Simple sine wave
x = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
y = [0, 0.841, 0.909, 0.141, -0.757, -0.959, -0.279];  % sin(x) values

% Create the plot
plot(x, y);

% Some calculations
amplitude = 1.0;
period = 6.28;
result = amplitude * period;
```

When run with RustMat, this will open a GPU-accelerated interactive window displaying the plot.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Key Components

RustMat's power comes from its highly modular, multi-crate architecture.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

RustMat is highly configurable. You can create a `.rustmat.yaml` file in your project or home directory to tune the JIT, GC, plotting, and more.

Run `rustmat config generate` to create a sample configuration file with all available options.

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions of all kinds! Whether you're interested in improving the parser, adding new standard library functions, or enhancing the JIT compiler, there are many ways to get involved.
