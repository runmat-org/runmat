## TL;DR

- **RunMat** is a modern, open-source runtime that executes MATLAB code fast.
- We implement the **full language grammar** and the **core semantics** (arrays, indexing, control flow, functions, cells/structs, OOP).
- The core stays **small and fast**; everything else grows via a **package system** (native Rust or source MATLAB).
- Core built-ins are **canonical** (e.g., `sin`, `cos`, `sum`, and `printf`-style formatting like `fprintf`/`sprintf`) and match the expected, documented behavior. When semantics are domain-specific or ambiguous, they live in packages.
- Built in **Rust**, with **tiered execution** (interpreter first, JIT for hot code) and a **generational GC** tuned for numerics.
- Benchmarks show **150x–180x speedups** vs GNU Octave on representative workloads; see Performance below.

## Why another runtime?

If you've written MATLAB code, you know the trade-offs:

- MATLAB is powerful but proprietary and heavy to start; deployment is license-bound.
- GNU Octave is free and compatible with lots of code, but startup and hot-path performance can be limiting.
- Moving to a new language means rewriting and - perhaps most importantly - **retraining**.

RunMat aims for a fourth path: keep the MATLAB language you know, but put it on a modern engine with a smaller core, clean semantics, and open extensibility.

## Language compatibility at a glance

A quick view of core language semantics. Full details: [here](/docs/language-coverage).

| Feature Category | RunMat | Octave |
| :-- | :--: | :--: |
| Grammar & parser (full MATLAB surface) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Arrays & indexing (`end`, colon, logical masks, N-D slicing) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Multiple returns, `varargin`/`varargout`, `nargin`/`nargout` | ✅ | ✅ |
| OOP `classdef` (props/methods), operator overloading | ✅ | ❌ |
| Events/handles (`addlistener`, `notify`, `isvalid`, `delete`) | ✅ | ❌ |
| Imports precedence & static access (`Class.*`) | ✅ | ❌ |
| Metaclass operator `?Class` | ✅ | ❌ |
| String arrays (double-quoted) | ✅ | ❌ |
| Standardized `MException` identifiers | ✅ | ❌ |

If something you rely on is not in the core, packages are the intended extension point.

## What RunMat is (and is not)

What it is:

- A new runtime that accepts MATLAB syntax and executes the core semantics quickly.
- A slim, production-oriented engine written in Rust with a stable Value/Type/ABI.
- A system that grows through packages: built-ins implemented in Rust or MATLAB.
- A **predictable core** of canonical built-ins (math, array ops, formatting/IO) with stable behavior; broader or niche functionality ships as packages.

What it is not:

- Not a re-packaging of MATLAB. We don't ship MATLAB code, assets, or toolboxes.
- Every historical builtin. We prioritize a small, consistent core and let packages provide breadth.
- Not affiliated with MathWorks; not a drop-in replacement for every workflow.

Legal clarity: RunMat is an independent project that implements a compatible language runtime. “MATLAB” is a MathWorks trademark; we use it nominatively to describe the language whose grammar and semantics our compiler/interpreter accepts. We are not endorsed by or associated with MathWorks.

## Performance

On an Apple M2 Max (32GB), our micro-benchmarks (matrix ops, math functions, control-flow loops) show large speedups over GNU Octave on the same machine:

### Summary results

| Benchmark | GNU Octave avg (s) | RunMat interp avg (s) | RunMat JIT avg (s) | Speedup vs Octave |
| :-- | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| Startup Time | 0.9147 | 0.0050 | 0.0053 | <span className="text-green-600 font-semibold">172x–183x faster</span> |
| Matrix Operations | 0.8220 | 0.0050 | 0.0050 | <span className="text-green-600 font-semibold">164x faster</span> |

| Control Flow | 0.8757 | 0.0057 | 0.0057 | <span className="text-green-600 font-semibold">155x faster</span> |

- We don't compare to MATLAB here due to licensing constraints (we decline to install Matlab and agree with their license terms). Our focus is the design: a slim core and a modern engine.
- Benchmarks are in the repo under `/benchmarks` with a script to reproduce. Numbers vary by hardware, BLAS, and build settings; please measure on your workload. To reproduce locally:

```bash
cd benchmarks
./run_benchmarks.sh
cat results/benchmark_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.yaml
```

## How it works

- **Ignition interpreter**: immediate execution, great for REPL and scripts.
- **Turbine JIT**: hot functions get compiled to optimized machine code (Cranelift backend).
- **Slim builtins**: a curated set in core; everything else via packages. Docs are generated from runtime metadata.
- **Great developer experience**: built in Jupyter kernel, flow-sensitive inference for great autocomplete and type hints, and more.
- **Portable**: single binary, no dependencies, runs on Linux/macOS/Windows and embedded devices.
- **GPU-optimized**: built in, configurable, swappable GPU planner with reverse-mode autograd support by default. Run your code on GPUs without any modifications across CPU, CUDA, ROCm, Metal, Vulkan, OpenCL, and WGPU platforms (coming soon).

For a deeper dive, see [How It Works](/docs/how-it-works) and the [Architecture & Internals](/docs/architecture) section.

## Packages: extending the runtime

Two ways to add capabilities:

- **Native (Rust) packages**: implement built-ins with `#[runtime_builtin]`, get strong typing and speed, and ship as a dynamic library.
- **Source (MATLAB) packages**: ship `.m` files; RunMat interprets or compiles them.

Documentation is generated from runtime metadata, so everything you add shows up in the reference automatically. See the [Package Manager](/docs/package-manager) doc for the full design and examples.

---

## What you can run today

- Core language: arrays, slicing (`end`, colon, logical masks), functions and multiple returns, cells/structs, OOP (`classdef` with properties/methods), `try/catch`, `global`, `persistent`, function handles, command-form.
- A curated builtin set in the runtime (canonical math like `sin/cos/tan`, reductions like `sum/min/max`, basic string/formatting via `fprintf/sprintf`, array creation like `zeros/ones/eye`), with more coming through packages.

If your code relies on many niche built-ins, the recommended path is to move those pieces into packages. The docs call out differences and migration notes where they exist.

A note about about plotting: RunMat's plot package is a work in progress. It's near-complete, but not yet ready for production use. We're working on it, and will have a complete plotting system in the next few releases.

## MATLAB, Octave, RunMat — a quick contrast

- **MATLAB**: proprietary, massive standard library, heavy startup, license-gated deployment. Feature-rich; closed source.
- **GNU Octave**: free, community-driven project with partial compatibility with MATLAB scripts. It carries a broad builtin surface and a classic interpreter architecture, but startup times and hot-loop performance can be poor. Octave is a full application; its design optimizes for breadth and compatibility.
- **RunMat**: open-source, modern engine with full language grammar and core semantics. We deliberately keep the core small and fast (canonical built-ins only) and move breadth into packages. This lets us optimize the engine aggressively for performance and predictability while still enabling a large library surface via the package system.

## Try it & get involved

- Read the docs: Getting Started, Design Philosophy, and How It Works.
- Browse the builtin reference; it's generated from the runtime.
- Star the repo and open issues: https://github.com/runmat-org/runmat
- Interested in contributing? Packages are the best place to start (Rust or MATLAB source).
