## Features Section

**Heading:** Why Use RunMat?

### Feature Cards

#### ✅ Full MATLAB Language Semantics
Run the whole language, not a subset: proper indexing (`end`/colon/masks), multiple returns, classdef OOP, events/handles—plus built-ins across arrays, linalg, FFT/signal, stats, strings, and I/O. See [coverage](/docs/language-coverage).

#### ⚡ Faster by Design (Fusion + Residency)
RunMat collapses back-to-back math into fewer GPU steps and keeps arrays on device, cutting memory traffic so scripts finish sooner. See [how it works](/docs/how-it-works).

#### 📦 Slim Core + Packages + IDE LSP
Single compact binary with a modern package system. Install native Rust or source MATLAB-style packages. First-class Language Server for VS Code/Cursor with hovers, errors, and go-to-docs. See the [package manager](/docs/package-manager).

#### 🧱 Portable + Lightweight
Same code, everywhere: static binaries with consistent performance on macOS/Windows/Linux and headless servers. GPU portability via Metal, DirectX 12, and Vulkan—no CUDA lock-in. Great for laptops, clusters, and CI.

## Write in MATLAB. Run on CPU or GPU Section

**Heading:** Write in MATLAB. Run on CPU or GPU.

**Description:** Same MATLAB-syntax you already know. Bring your existing MATLAB code and run as is. RunMat will translate your math to GPU code and run it automatically. No kernel code, no rewrites.

**Content:** Code example SVG visualization

## GPU Fusion Architecture Section

**Heading:** GPU Fusion Architecture, Why it's Fast

**Description:** RunMat fuses back-to-back math into fewer GPU steps and keeps arrays on the device between steps ("residency"). That means less memory traffic and fewer launches. so your scripts finish sooner.
