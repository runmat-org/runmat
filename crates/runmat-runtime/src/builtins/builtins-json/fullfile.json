  "description": "`fullfile` joins path segments using the platform-specific file separator, producing a single path string that matches MATLAB semantics. It accepts any number of path segments and returns a character row vector (`1xN`).",
  "behaviors": [
    "`fullfile(part1, part2, ...)` joins the inputs with the platform file separator (`/` on macOS and Linux, `\\` on Windows).",
    "Absolute path segments reset the accumulated path, mirroring MATLAB and OS path rules.",
    "Empty segments are ignored, so `fullfile(\"\", \"data\")` returns `data`.",
    "Inputs must be character vectors or string scalars. Single-element string arrays are accepted. Other input types raise `fullfile: arguments must be character vectors or string scalars`.",
    "The output is a character vector. Wrap the result with `string(...)` if you prefer string scalars."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Why does `fullfile` return a character vector instead of a string?",
      "answer": "MATLAB returns character vectors for `fullfile`. RunMat mirrors that behavior for compatibility; use `string(fullfile(...))` if you prefer string scalars."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does `fullfile` expand `~` to the home directory?",
      "answer": "No. `fullfile` performs string assembly only. Use `cd` or filesystem APIs that expand `~` when you need home expansion."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if a segment is absolute?",
      "answer": "Absolute segments reset the accumulated path, matching MATLAB and OS path rules."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I pass numeric character codes?",
      "answer": "Yes. Numeric arrays that represent character codes are accepted as long as they form a row vector, just like other RunMat text inputs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does `fullfile` run on the GPU?",
      "answer": "No. It is a host-only utility and gathers GPU-resident inputs before processing."

    "`fullfile` performs string manipulation on the CPU only. Any GPU-resident inputs are gathered to the host before path assembly so the resulting character vector is always in CPU memory."
