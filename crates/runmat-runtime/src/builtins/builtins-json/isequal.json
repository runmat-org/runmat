  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How is `isequal` different from `==`?",
      "answer": "`isequal` returns a single logical value indicating whether all inputs are completely identical. The `==` operator performs element-wise comparison and returns an array of the same size as the inputs."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does `isequal` handle NaN values?",
      "answer": "NaN values are NOT considered equal. `isequal(NaN, NaN)` returns `false`. Use `isequaln` if you want NaN values to be treated as equal."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I compare more than two arrays?",
      "answer": "Yes. `isequal(A, B, C, ...)` accepts any number of inputs and returns `true` only if all inputs are equal to each other."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are empty arrays equal?",
      "answer": "Empty arrays with the same shape are equal. For example, `isequal([], [])` returns `true`, and `isequal(zeros(0,3), zeros(0,3))` returns `true`."
    },
    {
      "question": "How are cell arrays compared?",
      "answer": "Cell arrays are compared element-by-element. Each corresponding pair of cells must contain equal values for the cell arrays to be equal."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens with different data types?",
      "answer": "Values of different classes are generally not equal. However, compatible numeric types (like `double` and `single`, or `double` and `logical`) may be compared after appropriate promotion."
