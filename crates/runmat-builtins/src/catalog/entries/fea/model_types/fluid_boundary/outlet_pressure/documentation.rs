            "The outlet prescribes the static pressure on the faces and leaves the velocity free, which is the usual pressure-outlet condition for internal flow. Because incompressible flow is driven by pressure differences, the outlet value also sets the pressure datum; a gauge value of 0 Pa is common.",
            "`id` names the boundary. It must be nonempty text (a character vector or string scalar) and should be unique among objects of the same kind in one model; validation messages and run evidence report it.",
            "`region` must be a `geometry.Region` returned by `geometry.region(asset, selector)`. The object stores the region id together with the region's `geometry_id` and `geometry_revision` (exposed as read-only properties, the revision as `uint32`), so `fea.model` rejects it when the model is built on a different asset or a different revision of the same asset.",
            "The region is recorded as a boundary-face target (`entity_dimension` `face`, cardinality one or more faces). Whether the selected region really is a set of faces is checked when the model is meshed and validated, not by the constructor.",
            "`pressure` must be a `fea.Pressure` in pascals.",
            "Physical values are passed as typed quantity objects (for example `fea.Temperature.celsius(25)`), never as bare numbers, so the unit is explicit at the call site. The quantity constructors convert to SI once and the object stores SI values.",
            "All inputs are checked before anything is built: a wrong argument count, a request for more than one output, a value of the wrong class, an empty identifier, or an out-of-range value raises `RunMat:fea:InvalidInput` and no object is returned.",
            "The result is an immutable host value object, not a handle: assigning it to another variable copies the value, and its properties are read-only. It encodes portably, so it can cross an execution boundary unchanged.",

A boundary is a natural (operator) condition that stays constant for the analysis; for a value that varies with time or frequency, use the matching `fea.*Excitation` method with a signal instead.",
            "Use it with a fluid step (`fea.FluidStep.steadyState` or `fea.FluidStep.transient`) together with an inlet condition such as `fea.FluidExcitation.inletVelocity` or `fea.FluidConstraint.prescribedVelocity`.",
