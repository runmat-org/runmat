            "A fixed constraint prescribes zero displacement for all translational degrees of freedom on the region, and zero rotation where the formulation carries rotational degrees of freedom (beams and shells). It is the most restrictive support: use it only where the physical fixture really prevents all motion, because over-constraint stiffens the model and can move stress concentrations to the clamped edge.",
            "`id` names the constraint. It must be nonempty text (a character vector or string scalar) and should be unique among objects of the same kind in one model; validation messages and run evidence report it. Step activations refer to it with `fea.StepObjectRef.constraint(id)`.",
            "`region` must be a `geometry.Region` returned by `geometry.region(asset, selector)`. The object stores the region id together with the region's `geometry_id` and `geometry_revision` (exposed as read-only properties, the revision as `uint32`), so `fea.model` rejects it when the model is built on a different asset or a different revision of the same asset.",
            "The region is recorded as a boundary-face target (`entity_dimension` `face`, cardinality one or more faces). Whether the selected region really is a set of faces is checked when the model is meshed and validated, not by the constructor.",
            "All inputs are checked before anything is built: a wrong argument count, a request for more than one output, a value of the wrong class, an empty identifier, or an out-of-range value raises `RunMat:fea:InvalidInput` and no object is returned.",
            "The result is an immutable host value object, not a handle: assigning it to another variable copies the value, and its properties are read-only. It encodes portably, so it can cross an execution boundary unchanged.",
