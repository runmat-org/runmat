            "A distributing coupling ties the reference-point motion to a weighted average of the region motion, so force and moment resultants applied at the reference point reach the face without forcing it to stay rigid. It suits load introduction through a flexible interface, such as a bearing load on a bore.",
            "`id` names the constraint. It must be nonempty text (a character vector or string scalar) and should be unique among objects of the same kind in one model; validation messages and run evidence report it. Step activations refer to it with `fea.StepObjectRef.constraint(id)`.",
            "`region` must be a `geometry.Region` returned by `geometry.region(asset, selector)`. The object stores the region id together with the region's `geometry_id` and `geometry_revision` (exposed as read-only properties, the revision as `uint32`), so `fea.model` rejects it when the model is built on a different asset or a different revision of the same asset.",
            "The region is recorded as a boundary-face target (`entity_dimension` `face`, cardinality one or more faces). Whether the selected region really is a set of faces is checked when the model is meshed and validated, not by the constructor.",
            "`referencePoint` must be a `fea.ReferencePoint` from `fea.ReferencePoint.fromCoordinates(id, position)`.",

            "The result is an immutable host value object, not a handle: assigning it to another variable copies the value, and its properties are read-only. It encodes portably, so it can cross an execution boundary unchanged.",
