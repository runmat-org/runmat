Your colleage had a deep dive to understand the tricks of the trade in the Symbolica repo. 
C:\GitHub\symbolica

Then he thought of refactorings profiting from runmat
data structures, and IR/JIT structure.

He created the following docs:

DEEP_DIVE_ANALYSIS.md
REFACTORING_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
PHASE_1_COMPLETION.md

Your task is to implement the symbolic engine for runmat (here).
- use only runmat idiom and naming rules, avoid Symbolica naming.
-> avoid what might be considered as copyright infringement.
That means we have to carefully review if Symbolica has a USC, never seen before -> then do not use it and instead use more known-in-the-art stuff.
Exception: runmat has a similar pipeline which directly leads to such use, without knowing Symbolica.
Ask if in doubt.

We are on Windows, so adapt curl and other calls.
We compile using MinGW, so use
set PATH=C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin;C:\msys64\usr\bin;%PATH%
set CPATH=C:\msys64\ucrt64\include
set LIBRARY_PATH=C:\msys64\ucrt64\lib
cargo build ...
